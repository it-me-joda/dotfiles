# This is my current desktop setup

After a long time on the Fedora train (and every spin), I decided to try my hand with Arch. To ease the transition, I chose EndeavourOS. I also chose Hyprland as my new Window Manager. I've been enjoying it a TON. The upfront cost (a couple days at first and several small tangets here and there) to get everything exactly the way you want it pays huge dividends in productivity and better user experience. Currently, I use VSCodium and neovim as my main editors and I have a helix config but since plugins are unlikely to arrive it's probably dead for my needs. If I can think of anything else or make any changes, I will try to add it here.
